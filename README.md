# Legal_DD_File
Uses Zuva API to conduct legal due diligence for a venture capital investment

Please see the Zuva [Github](https://github.com/zuvaai/zdai-python)) for getting set up on the application. You will need to add a number of packages if you do not already have them. 

You should also use jupyter notebook for getting set up. So far, this is only usable with Python.
