# Legal_DD_File
Uses Zuva API to conduct legal due diligence for a venture capital investment.

You will need to create an account on [Zuva](https://zuva.ai/) to get started. 

Please see the Zuva [Github](https://github.com/zuvaai/zdai-python) for getting set up on the application. You will need to add a number of packages if you do not already have them. 

You should also use Jupyter Notebook to get set up. So far, this is only usable with Python. 

Please use the dd.ipynb file and make a copy for your own use. This is definitely a project in the making so keep me updated on how you are using it.
